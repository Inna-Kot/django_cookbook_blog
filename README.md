1. At the beginning of making my project I didn't copy the commands provided by GitHub to create a new repository on the command line. I connected my GitHub repository to VS Code successfully but it was some problem to save changes that I made at VS Code. Terminal said that "Changes not staged for commit". My index.html file was in a wrong directory. .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/index.html. I moved it to .github folder, commited and pushed changes to github repository.
